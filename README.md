# Application Framework

Provides a convenient base for JavaFX applications.

## Features

- remembers locations of windows and user selection
- demonstrates basic common UI paradigms (list/table with attached detail view, etc.)
- provides a common icons generator
- runtime stylesheet generator

This is pretty much work in progress, so don't even think of using it in production.  The APIs will definitely change.
