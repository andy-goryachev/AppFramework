# Application Framework

Provides a convenient base for JavaFX applications.



## Features

- remembers window locations and user choices
- demonstrates common UI layouts (list/table with attached detail view, etc.)
- runtime stylesheet generator

This is pretty much work in progress, so don't even think of using it in production.

The APIs are guaranteed to change.

icon generator, actions, multiple windows, etc.

The main application window:
[MainWindow.java](src/demo/appfw/MainWindow.java)
